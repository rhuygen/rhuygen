### Rik Huygen

I work at the [Institute of Astronomy](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/), which is a division of the Physics department at the [University of Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/) in Belgium. I'm currently working on the [PLATO Project](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Plato) which is a medium-class ESA science mission in search for terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around solar-like stars, an exoplanet mission. My contribution to the PLATO Project is the Common-EGSE which will be used to execute the Camera Tests at four different collaborating institutes.
