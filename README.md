### Rik Huygen

I work at the [Institute of Astronomy](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/), which is a division of the Physics department at the [University of Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/) in Belgium. I'm currently working on the [PLATO Project](https://sci.esa.int/web/plato/) which is a medium-class ESA science mission in search for terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around solar-like stars, an exoplanet mission.
